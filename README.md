# Feature Barcode QC

[![Snakemake](https://img.shields.io/badge/snakemake-≥3.12.0-brightgreen.svg)](https://snakemake.bitbucket.io)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/khavarilab/featurebarcode-qc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/khavarilab/featurebarcode-qc)

This is a workflow built in snakemake to process a feature barcode library from a 10X scRNA-seq experiment. Starting from raw sequencing reads, the pipeline will map to reference of feature barcodes, quantify cell barcodes and UMIs, and generate an analysis report.

## Usage

### Simple

#### Step 1: Install workflow

If you simply want to use this workflow, download and extract the [latest release](https://github.com/khavarilab/featurebarcode-qc/releases).
If you intend to modify and further extend this workflow or want to work under version control, fork this repository as outlined in [Advanced](#advanced).

Clone this repositiory and change into that directory.

Ensure you have `conda` installed, then create and activate the environment

```
$ conda env create -q -f=envs/conda.yaml -n featurebarcode-qc-snakemake
$ conda activate featurebarcode-qc-snakemake
```

Run the snakemake on a test dataset

```
$ snakemake --directory .test
```

Examine the outputs of the workflow in the directory ```.test/outs/```


#### Step 2: Configure workflow

Configure the workflow according to your needs via editing the file `config.yaml`. This includes the path to the fasta file of reference feature barcodes, the directory of fastq files, location of plasmid library sequencing, and how targets are specified in the names of the features.

See the `.test_pdna_only` directory for an example of how to run an analysis on just the plasmid sequencing.
See the `.test_sample_barcode` directory for an example of how to run an analysis if your features sequenced include sample barcodes.

#### Step 3: Execute workflow

Ensure the correct conda environment is active with

```
$ conda activate featurebarcode-qc-snakemake
```

Test your configuration by performing a dry-run via

```
$ snakemake -n
```

Execute the workflow locally via

```
$ snakemake --cores $N
```

using `$N` cores or run it in a cluster environment via

```
$ snakemake --cluster qsub --jobs $N
```


# Step 4: Investigate results

The main outputs are ```outs/feature_counts.txt``` containing the number of unique UMIs per feature per cell barcode, and an HTML report with basic analysis and figures at ```outs/featurebarcode-qc-report.html```. 

After successful execution, you can create a self-contained interactive HTML report with workflow statistics.

```$ snakemake --report report.html```

This report can, e.g., be forwarded to your collaborators.

### Updating the workflow

If you installed the workflow by cloning the github repo, you can pull latest updates to workflow with 

```$ git pull --rebase```

This will require you to first commit any changes you made to your configuration file before pulling new updates.

Then simply rerun the `snakemake` command.

### Advanced

The following recipe provides established best practices for running and extending this workflow in a reproducible way.

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) the repo to a personal or lab account.
2. [Clone](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository) the fork to the desired working directory for the concrete project/run on your machine.
3. [Create a new branch](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial#_managing_branches) (the project-branch) within the clone and switch to it. The branch will contain any project-specific modifications (e.g. to configuration, but also to code).
4. Modify the config, and any necessary sheets (and probably the workflow) as needed.
5. Commit any changes and push the project-branch to your fork on github.
6. Run the analysis.
7. Optional: Merge back any valuable and generalizable changes to the [upstream repo](https://github.com/khavarilab/featurebarcode-qc) via a [**pull request**](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request). This would be **greatly appreciated**.
8. Optional: Push results (plots/tables) to the remote branch on your fork.
9. Optional: Create a self-contained workflow archive for publication along with the paper (snakemake --archive).
10. Optional: Delete the local clone/workdir to free space.


## Testing

Tests cases are in the subfolder `.test`. They are automtically executed via continuous integration with Travis CI.
